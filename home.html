        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            At Electric Vehicles Hub, we are driven by our passion for a greener,
            more sustainable future. We believe that electric vehicles represent a
            significant step towards reducing our carbon footprint, improving air
            quality, and embracing a more eco-conscious approach to transportation.
            Our mission is to promote the adoption of electric vehicles and provide
            valuable resources for EV enthusiasts, whether you're a seasoned EV

            <h3>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):</h3>
            <p>
                Explanation: BEVs are fully electric vehicles that rely solely on a
                battery to store and deliver energy to power an electric motor. They
                have no internal combustion engine and produce zero tailpipe
                emissions. BEVs are charged by plugging into an electrical outlet or
                charging station.

            <h3>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles</h3>
            <p>
                Explanation: PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an
                electric motor and a battery. They can run on electricity alone for a
                limited range, after which the internal combustion engine kicks in.
                PHEVs can also be charged using an electrical outlet or charging
                station, providing flexibility between electric and gasoline power.

            <h3>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs):</h3>
            <p>
                Explanation: HEVs have both an internal combustion engine and an
                electric motor but cannot be charged externally. They use regenerative
                braking to recharge the battery and improve fuel efficiency by
                switching between the two power sources as needed. HEVs do not produce
                tailpipe emissions while running on electricity.

            <h3>Rideshare and Micromobility Electric Vehicles</h3>
            <p>
                Explanation: Some rideshare companies and micromobility services offer
                electric options for short trips within cities. These include electric
                scooters, bikes, and small electric cars for rent by the minute or
                hour.
